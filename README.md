### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
- Eclipse
- JDK1.8
- Plugins
  - xText
  - xTend
  - xSemantics    
```

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

1. In eclipse,import the project by cloning the git uri
      - https://github.com/suhabb/JsonQ.git
2. Add below jars as external jar file(availabe in lib_jars folder of the JsonLib Project) in JsonLib Project.
    - json-20201115.jar (https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.json/json/20201115)
    - junit-4.0.jar (https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/junit/junit/4.0
3. Go to eclipse JsonQRuntime Project -> Properties -> Java Build Path -> Classpath -> Project add `JsonLib` as its a dependent project.This should remove all the compilation errors in the JsonQRunTime Project.
4. Add ``json-20201115.jar`` as external jar file in JsonQRuntime project .
5.  In JsonQRuntime project, create a resource package under src folder and copy this file ``covid_vaccination.json`` available in JsonLib (src/resource) folder. See below for link:
      - The ``covid_vaccination.json`` file is available in JsonLib project.
        - https://github.com/suhabb/JsonQ/tree/main/JsonLib/src/resource
      - src/resource
        - covid_vaccination.json
  6. Run the JSONQueryMain.java file from the src package
  
## JsonLib
  - JsonLib is the library project to run RuntimeJsonQEclipse( ``JsonQRuntime``).This project takes json query parameters and returns the search results in Java Swing Executables files
  - There is a file called ``covid_vaccination.json`` under src/resource package.This file is used as database source.
 
## JsonQRuntime
  - This project is Runtime Isntance of the JsonDSL project.
  - https://github.com/suhabb/JsonDSL.git
     
### Running the Project

1. In runtime eclipse, create a  new file with extension .jq under /src package.
    ```
    Example: JsonQ.jq
    ```
3. Write a query like below :
    ```
      - GET DATA WHERE isVaccinated "Yes"
      - GET DATA WHERE firstName "Ami" AND gender "Female"
      - GET COUNT WHERE isVaccinated "Yes" AND gender "Male"
      - GET AVG "income" WHERE isVaccinated "No" AND gender "Female"
    ```
    
4. This is the sample data of json stored : 
  ```
    {
      "id": 1,
      "firstName": "Ami",
      "lastName": "Canlin",
      "gender": "Female",
      "countryCode": "BR",
      "cityName": "Cachoeiras de Macacu",
      "isVaccinated": "Yes",
      "income": "77142"
},
{
      "id": 2,
      "firstName": "Welby",
      "lastName": "Cogle",
      "gender": "Male",
      "countryCode": "CN",
      "cityName": "Qinglung",
      "isVaccinated": "Yes",
      "income": "77048"
  }
  ```
  5.  After writing the query save the file, and you see that ```JSONQueryMain.java``` file gets created under ``/src-gen`` folder. Right click on this file and       run as main program. A java swing executable console displaying results open for each query.
      ```Note: You may need to drag the console as they will be hidden behind each other```
